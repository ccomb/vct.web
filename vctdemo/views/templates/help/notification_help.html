<h2 style="text-align: center;">Notifications</h2>
Version 1.5, 14 June 2010, <span style="font-style: italic;">(Considered
specifications not yet implemented in this prototype are
presented in italic)</span>.
<ul>
<li>Introduction:</li>
<ul>
<li>Pull approach:</li>
<ul>
<li>Shared informations are always available on demand from
authorized users.</li>
<li>Incoming informations are set immedialtely in the data base,
if
possible directly in the right patient record or otherwise waiting in a
kind of personal mailbox of the target user.&nbsp; But nothing will
happen until the user will take the initiative to pay attention to a
particular patient or to his generic mail box.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Push approach:</li>
<ul>
<li>Since the user cannot know when new information will arise,
he may want to be notified as sonn as possible in case of new
informations which are particularly relevant for him.
This can be achieved in 2 ways, by means of notifications and/or
subscriptions:</li>
<ul>
<li>Notifications:</li>
<ul>
<li>Notifications are a descision of the creator or sender of
the information. The creator of the information did declare he was
believing the new information was relevant to you.</li>
<ul>
<li>For example the requester of a lab test want to be
informed of the availability of the result. However the other
members of the care team of the patient would probably not like to be
bothered about the patient before they would see him again at a later
time.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Subscritions:</li>
<ul>
<li>A
subscription is a decision of the user, who want to be informed of any
change in a specific list of patients he is particularly responsible
of.
</li>
<ul>
<li>For example the coordinator of a critical patient wants
to know immediately about any new event.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Presentation:</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-style: italic;">Whatever the above method, the
notification button provides a list of documents you should have a look
at. 
</li>
<li style="font-style: italic;">Clicking on an element of the list
will open the appropriate patient record and the specific new
document(s) inside that patient record. When viewed the document(s)
will disappear from the list, but of course remain accessible on demand
as any other normal document.</li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Notification information not
associated with a reliable patient identification, will be set in a
kind of mailbox.&nbsp; The user will have to decide what to do, and
could still move these messages to the appropriate patient</span>.
