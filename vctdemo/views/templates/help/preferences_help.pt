<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<ul>
<li>One patient record:</li>
<ul>
<li>The main goal of the project is to help the members of the
personal Care Team of the patient to share information about the
patient, i.e. to access the patient record.&nbsp; In order to share
patient information in an efficient way, there is in principle only one
common patient record. </li>
</ul>
<li>Different views:</li>
<ul>
<li>Since the Care Team is multidisciplinary, the users look at
this common patient record in different ways, depending on their roles
and professional background.&nbsp; Therefore it is important that the
users can mamnage their own preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>Remark:</li>
<ul>
<li>The project is based here on a "patient centric record" and
no more to make completely different softwares for every professional
group, as GP, specialists, nurses, paramedical professionals, ...&nbsp;
The problem was that&nbsp; separate software had very difficult to
share information. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Overview of of a user:</li>
<ul>
<li>Identification:</li>
<ul>
<li>Legal identification. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Addres, telephones, Email, .... </li>
</ul>
<li>User preferences:</li>
<ul>
<li>Language:</li>
<li>Types of views:</li>
<ul>
<li>In general in function of professional profile:</li>
<ul>
<li>Information relevant to the role of the user and taking
account of the permissions. </li>
<li>Default options will be proposed but may be modified
according to personal preferences. </li>
</ul>
<li>Screen style</li>
<li>First page when opening a patient record:</li>

</ul>
<li>Management of user information:</li>
<ul>
<li>By the network manager:</li>
<ul>
<li>In begin the direction of the healthcare organization has a
global responsibility, particularly the responsibility to delegate
missions to well identified and accredited collaborators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>This is why the management of key information is restricted
to the network manager:</li>
<ul>
<li>Creation of new users,</li>
<li>Professional accreditaion,</li>
<li>Delegations of authorizations, which kind of information
may be read and/or modified. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>By the users themselves:</li>
<ul>
<li>Most other information should be be maintained by the user
himself.</li>
<li>The user's preference may be modified at any time by the user
himself.</li>
</ul>
<li>Remark:&nbsp; anyhow, any changes in the user profile will be
traced. </li>
</ul>
