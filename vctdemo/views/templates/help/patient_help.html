<h2 style="text-align: center;">Patient identification</h2>
Version 2.1, 7 June 2010, <span style="font-style: italic;">(Considered
specifications not yet implemented in this prototype are
presented in italic)</span>.<br />
<ul>
  <li>How to search for a patient:<br />
There are several ways to search for patient records:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Search by means of the decriptive identification, including
last name, name, bithday, sex.&nbsp; <br />
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. informations which are not unique, but their association provide a relative high probability to find the right patient.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Search by means of a patient identification code: <br />
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>An identification code is valid as far as pointing to
exclusively one well defined patient record in a known
environment.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">A patient has
often several identification codes in different information spaces, for
example a local hospital number, an other one in an other medical
center, an identification code in a given insurance system, a national
identification number in a given country, etc.... This is why the
identification space must always be known.</span><br />
In a preliminary version of the prototype we assume here by default
that the current server support only one identification system. <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Retrieval of a predefined group of patients and selection of
one patient proposed inside that group.&nbsp; <br />
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Moreover left and rigth arrows allow to move to the previous
or the next patient record in the same group.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Results of the search:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>All these methods provide a small table of zero, one or several
candidates with a summary of a few key information. Be careful to check
the
right patient.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Selection of a record:<br />
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the intended patient is presented:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on that line in order to open the record. Be careful in
large populations more thean one patient could have the same
descriptors.&nbsp; If not sure create a new record as explained below.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>If the intentended patient is not presented:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>You have the possibility to correct an error an to try again.</li>
      <li>Create a new record:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A few more informations will normally be asked the first
time, as address, telephone, insurance, ... and they could be adapted
at any time later on.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Important remark:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There are 2 kinds of risks:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>To create an unnecessary second record for the ssame
patient.&nbsp; Of course a little annoying but actually not worse than
the old situation when patients did have many unrelated paper records.<br />
          </li>
          <li>To mixt information of 2 different patients in the same
record.&nbsp; A far more dangerous error.&nbsp; One of the 2 patient
could get a wrong blood transfusion of the blood group of the other!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In case of doubt make a new record, particularly when the
available identification information is incomplete.</li>
        <li>Later on a special procedure will allow a merge after a
complete verification.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Opening the content of a patient record:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The result of the previous step is the opening of a patient
record, either retrieving an already existing one, either having
created a new empty record.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Access to the content of a patient record depend on
access rules, from the point of views of confidentiality ans
responsibilities, in function of:<br />
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The profile of he current user, having a set of permanent
permissions, allowing or not allowing, to do some tasks as reading
information or taking responsibilities when entering new information,
for example introducing a drug prescription.<br />
      </li>
      <li>The role of the current user for the particular current
patient.&nbsp; As a short summary:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The general principle are that exclusively the persons
,necessary for the care of the patient and having an agreement from the
patient, will have an access to the content of the patient record.<br />
        </li>
        <li style="font-style: italic;">In practice the system
maintains a table of authorized users known as members of the personal
care team of the patient.&nbsp; Exclusively these user are allowed to
access the patient record.</li>
        <li style="font-style: italic;">Memberships in the care team
are not lifelong but always of limited duration after the latest
transaction, up to delay after which the care relation will no more be
obvious, for example a year.<br />
        </li>
        <li style="font-style: italic;">At any time the patient may ask
for extension of his care team to a new user.&nbsp; He could also
revoque a user.&nbsp; In case of an emergencythe control could be
forced, but then a justification will be specially traced.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Closing a patient record:<br />
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>When finished do not forget to close the patient record.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Moreover if no more activity during a
given timeout delay the record will be automatically be closed, as well
the user session.</span><br />
    </li>
    <li>Be sure to have validated any new information before
closing.&nbsp; What has not been validated or signed would not be saved
in the archives.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Warning will
be issued in case of doubts.</span><br />
    </li>
    <li>Opening a new patient record will automatically close the
previous one.&nbsp; There is normally only one active patient record at
a time.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">However if necessary
it is easy to go back to a previous
patient via the group of the current session.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Closing the user session:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When the user quit the premises, he is responsible to close his
session.&nbsp; The next time he will have to provide his authentication
again.</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Moreover as safety measures,
the session will be automatically closed after a given delay after the
latest activity.&nbsp; A user is in rinciple not allowed to open more
than one session on one machine at a time.</span><br />
    </li>
  </ul>
